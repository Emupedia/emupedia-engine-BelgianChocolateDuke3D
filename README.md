# Chocolate Duke3D

Chocolate Duke Nukem 3D is the equivalent of [Chocolate Doom](http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom).

A **port** that:

1. Remains as faithful as possible to the original source code.
2. Portable and compiling in one click on Windows, OS X and Linux.
3. Aimed at education, with lots of comments and documentation added in order to help programmers to understand and learn.

## Belgian Chocolate Duke3D

This is a fork of Fabien Sanglard's project [Chocolate Duke Nukem 3D](https://github.com/fabiensanglard/chocolate_duke3D). As of January 2020, Fabien has archived his git repository.

After reading both Fabien Sanglard's Game Engine Black Books on [Wolfenstein 3D](https://github.com/fabiensanglard/gebbwolf3) and [Doom](https://github.com/fabiensanglard/gebbdoom), I slowly got curious on how Duke 3D would perform on a modern computer (an Intel Core i9-9900K) with a modern Operating System (Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04). After cloning his Chocolate Duke 3D git repository, I had to spend a bit of time getting the project up and running. While doing that, I've been keeping on adding some improvements.

* Ported to SDL2.
* Ported to vcpkg and CMake.
* Added continuous integration (via GitHub Actions).
* Added 64-bit support (savegames are compatible between 32-bit and 64-bit).

### Known Issues

* Linux: MIDI does not play (vcpkg does not configure sdl2-mixer for it).
* Engine: Leaning left/right falls back to low-res rendering.
* Engine: Minimap has rendering glitches when fully-textured.
* Engine: Pixel imprecision when rendering health/ammo numbers in the status bar, leaving ghost pixels.

## Requirements

An original copy of [Duke Nukem 3D](https://3drealms.com/catalog/duke-nukem-3d_27/). Specifically the DUKE3D.GRP file from the original CD in binary working directory.
